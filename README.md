### Tokens, Contracts, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pactus doesn't support contracts for now, this section will be added after contract support.

### TestNet

Other networks, such as Phoenix test network assets can be found in their specific directory, containing the accounts, and validators files beside their readme and docs.

For example, you can find Phoenix TestNet assets [here](./phoenix).

## Contribution

Please make sure you are adding a famous or well-known address and assets. make sure you are following the correct JSON format.

### Accounts

To add an account, please make sure you add it to the correct network (phoenix, mainnet, and ...).
You have to provide proof that this is a well-known address and this is the correct address for the name, website, and logo you are providing.

### Validators

To add a validator (you can add your validator too), you have to be a node runner or a featured validator. you need to have a website, logo, and contact email and use an official name, logo, website, and email not a personal one.


> Consider that you have to use correct and not broken links. if the links stopped working we will contact you and ask you to update it, otherwise we will remove the record or link itself.


## Usage

You can use these assets to show the name, logo, and link instead of only the address on your service such as Explorer, etc.
For example, you can use [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PACZone/pactus-assets/main/mainnet/accounts.json), to get all MainNet accounts listed here with metadata.
